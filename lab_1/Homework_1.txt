1. You evaluated results for two fundamentally different, but due to their similar names often confused algorithms, k-Means and k-Nearest Neighbours.
a) Which one does classification, which one is a clustering method?  
K-M clustering 
K-NN classification

b) One of the methods is a supervised method, one is unsupervised. Which one is which, and what does that mean?
K-M UnSupervised 
K-NN Supervised

2. You used different tools built into SciKitLearn to evaluate your implementation. 
a) What is represented in the rows and columns of a confusion matrix produced with metrics.confusion_matrix( <test_labels>, <predicted>)? 
Row is actual number
column is predicted number

b) What are the elements of the classification report, i.e., what do the terms precision, recall, f1-score, support, accuracy, macro avg, and weighted avg mean and what do the rows in the table represent when you generate a report with metrics.classification_report( <test_labels>, <predicted>)?

As defined by sklearn Precision-Recall (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_precision_recall.html):
"Precision (P) is defined as the number of true positives over the number of true positives plus the number of false positives"
"Recall (R) is defined as the number of true positives over the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives"
"These quantities are also related to the F1 score, which is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall" (2 * (P * R) / (P + R))
support "is the number of occurrences of each class in y_true".
accuracy is the average amount of correct answers. n_correct_predictions / n_samples
macro avg "is averaging the unweighted mean per label" 
Weighted avg mean "is averaging the support-weighted mean per label"

c) Obviously, the classification report and confusion matrix are not suitable tools to evaluate a clustering algorithm's results directly. Some better suited measures are:
metrics.completeness_score( <train_labels>, <clustered>)
metrics.homogeneity_score( <train_labels>, <clustered>)
What do those tell you?

completeness_score: "A clustering result satisfies completeness if all the data points that are members of a given class are elements of the same cluster"
homogeneity_score: "A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain only data points which are members of a single class"
