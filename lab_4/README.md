The handout includes the NMNIST-light data set, which is somewhat more elaborate and larger than the one given in SciKitLearn - but the principle is the same. Images here have 20x20 pixels that can take values from 0 to 255, and there are 5000 images in the set.

The two notebooks are skeletons (one is more of a stubb) for implementing the different Bayesian Classifiers (HandoutSkeleton_GNB) and for working with a suggested implementation of the EM-algorithm (HandoutSkeleton_EM). Note that it is perfectly fine to change (optimise) the EM-implementation, but please do that only after you have found a good solution to the actual task of finding a good starting configuration.
